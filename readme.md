//in index file we connect the database
//in app file we do configuration regarding cookies,backend all basic configurations happen here
//contants file : It's a very important file it restricts thing in a professional manner.
//DB directory contains actual code that connects with database
//Model:structure of data or schema needs to be there which is in present in Model directory. Every library has a different schema like mongoose has a different schema
//controllers directory : all the functionalities are written here like methods and functions are written here
//routes : /login or /sign up like when you come to these pages some function gets called.
//middlewares
//utils folder : a function like sending mail which is used in many instances like sending a mail when doing forget password and reset passsword and 50 other functions we utilize sending mail.
so functions like this are contained here

This diagram lays out the basic flow of a Node.js/Express backend talking to a client and a database:

Client (Computer/Mobile)

Your browser or mobile app that sends HTTP requests (e.g. GET) and receives responses.

Express Server

Receives incoming requests via app.get(…) or other HTTP verbs.

Defines routes, for example:

/ → the home route

/login → the login route

Uses app.listen(...) to start the server and listen on a port.

Mongoose (MongoDB)

The ORM layer you’d use inside your Express handlers to query or update your MongoDB database.

Request flow:

Client issues a GET (or POST, etc.) to one of your defined routes.

Express matches the route, runs your handler (which can call Mongoose to fetch or save data).

Your handler sends back an HTTP response to the client.

This simple setup is the core of most JS backends—Express handles routing and HTTP, Mongoose handles data persistence, and your Node.js process ties it all together.
